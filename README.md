# C++ TextBuffer Implementation

This is a C++17 port of VSCode's text buffer implementation with Unicode support. The implementation is based on a Piece Table data structure for efficient text editing.

## Features
- Modern C++17 code
- Unicode support via UTF-8 encoding
- Memory-efficient editing of large files
- Same logic and structure as the original VSCode implementation

## Building
This project requires a C++17 compatible compiler.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage
See the examples directory for usage examples.
